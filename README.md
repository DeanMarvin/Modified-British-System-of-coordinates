# Modified-British-System-of-coordinates

The Army Forces involved in the WWII were for the most brought to define and to use specific geographical coordinate systems in order to specify the localization of points or targets located on the theater of operations.

This QGIS Plugin converts coordinates of "Nord de Guerre Zone" Grid into coordinates of current coordinate reference systems (e.g. WGS84).
